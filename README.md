## Please note
                                                                      
[1] In the section ([0] Install and configure requirements) when we click on option 1 to install the requirements, it will ask us to set up a user who does not have root permissions; this step is very important, because if we set up a user with root permissions, or type it incorrectly, or set it double, the options to open a browser from the terminal will not work.

[2] In the section ([0] Installation and configuration requirements) we can configure the APIs of veriphone.io, shodan.io and zoomeye.org to get the best out of this tool, both of which are free.

[3] In the section ([7] Public IP information) with the use of VPN most servers give incorrect port responses. To solve this problem, I set up several scanners and two of them provide the correct ports despite the VPN.

[4] Use the tool with Firefox closed, because the tool opens multiple tabs and if Firefox is already running you will still get an error.

[5] Personally, I recommend using the tool with the terminal in full screen (better graphically).
